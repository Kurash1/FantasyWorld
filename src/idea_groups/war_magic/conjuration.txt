It has been practiced for centuries by witch covens and wizards throughout Tamriel. Clan Direnni's sorcerers were some of the first to formalize the rituals, chants, and incantations used to open a connection with the plane of Oblivion, many of which are still standard centuries later. This school can be used to summon a wide range of daedric creatures, weapons and armor."
