Any treaty we sign with other nations will look like it was always the ideal of the foreign government in the first place. No agreement we ever sign is to be broken at all or it would shatter the carefully constructed narrative in an instant. But we can refine this even further. By sending exactly the right diplomat to the right person in a foreign country we almost assure success."
