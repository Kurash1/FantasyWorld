	desc = "The archetypical hobgoblin government is merely a reflection of their military hierarchy with a host being the largest field unit a hobgoblin knows apart from the now defunt Great Host. A Host is always headed by a powerful general, who made their way up the ranks. In the past those generals however were appointed by the Lord General of the Great Host. Hosts are further subdivided into stricts, who in turn are also subdivided into further subdivisions: orders followed by units. Such a unit is the smallest known entity of several individuals in Hobgoblin society. A unit is often the one a hobgoblin is sorted into at birth but can be made up from scratch in case of severe battlefield casualities or other needs. In such a unit seven young hobgoblins learn whatever tasks they got assigned to by the upper echelons of military hierarchy. The orders they form together with with fourteen other units is always led by a knight, who in turn is subservient to the Knight-Commander of any given Strict. A Strict is likewise made up out of eight orders and atleast two Stricts make one Host. Government henceforth is a purely stratocratic endeavour with high military leaders making all the decisions. Yet there is a theocratic twist to this as their god is one of tactics and strategy. Their government echoes this in ways non hobgoblins would struggle to comprehend properly."
